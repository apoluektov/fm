This is my solution for the 'follower-maze' problem I coded while applying to SoundCloud.

The solution demonstrates usage of blocking select with non-blocking sockets.
Once the server starts, it creates thread for listening polling network and all event dispatching work is being done in that single thread.
The main thread can be used for communication with the user/other piece of software.
The local socket is used for communication between the threads, which in my opinion is a quite elegant reusing of the polling thread main loop.
